            Cookies are one of the most misunderstood pieces of the modern web.
            While technically a cookie is just a simple
            <a
              @mouseover="showHoverTip = !showHoverTip, hoverTip('txtImg')"
              @mouseleave="showHoverTip = !showHoverTip, hoverTip()"

            stored on your computer when you visit websites, its purposes are
            often confusing. The technology that enables basic online shopping
            is the same technology that allows third parties to track your
            movement across all your online activities. That raw power makes
            this worthy of a deeper dive.
          </p>
          <p>
            To illustrate this, I did my own experiment. Starting with a clean
            slate, I cleared my browsing history, cache, and cookies. I then
            browsed the US internet's most popular websites<sup>[1]</sup> for
            one uninterrupted hour. At the end of the hour, I exported the
            <span class="datum">1,117</span> new cookies that were placed on my
            computer during that time, with the help of a
            <a

              target="_blank"

              Cookies can be described as either
              <span class="emphasis">first-party</span> or
              <span class="emphasis">third-party</span>. The distinction is
              based on whether the cookie comes from the domain of the website
              you're visiting (the website displayed in the URL bar) or whether
              it comes from a different, third-party domain (i.e. ads.com).
            </p>
            <p>
              A total of <span class="datum">472</span> first-party cookies and
              <span class="datum">660</span> third-party cookies were placed on
              my computer from visiting 25 websites in one hour.
            </p>
            <p>
              That sounds like a lot for such a short amount of time. Let's take
              a look at first-party cookies.

            <h5 class="total">First-Party Cookies Only</h5>
            <p>
              When categorizing by site type, it's clear that both
              <span class="emphasis">News</span> and
              <span class="emphasis">Entertainment</span> related websites
              placed the largest amount of first-party cookies on my computer.

          <div class="text-area">
            <!-- <h5 class="total">first-party Cookies Only</h5> -->
            <p>
              Every site I visited placed at least two first-party cookies on my
              computer. Yahoo stored just <span class="datum">two</span> cookies
              on my computer while Wired.com placed
              <span class="datum">60</span> as I was reading a single article.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second to Wired.com was the clothing company, Everlane. Do you
              ever get that feeling that the same ads are
              <i>following you everywhere you go?</i> <br /><br />Well, cookies
              make that possible and

            <p>
              What kind of information do we know about each cookie?
              Unfortunately, the standard cookie file format does not include a
              purpose or description which means it's impossible to know with
              certainty how the cookies on my computer are being used.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, there are a few sites dedicated to cataloging cookies and
              their purpose. I used
              <a href="https://cookiepedia.co.uk/">Cookiepedia</a> to do my

              In addition to the sheer volume of third-party cookies, it's
              immediately clear that most of these cookies have
              <span class="emphasis">unknown</span>
              origins. While some context clues can help determine what category
              of domain I was browsing, there is no easy way to definitively say
              what site I was on when these third-party cookies were placed on
              my computer.

            <h5 class="total">Cookie Classifications by Type</h5>
            <p>
              In addition to classifying first-party vs. third-party, cookies
              can also be classified as
              <span class="emphasis">persistent</span> vs.
              <span class="emphasis">session</span>. Session cookies are only
              stored on your computer while you're browsing and are deleted as
              soon as you close your window. Persistent cookies, on the other
              hand, have an expiration date that supersedes the closing of your
              browser window. During my one hour of browsing,
              <span class="datum">92%</span> of the cookies stored were the
              persistent type.
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, session cookies are used for functional purposes like
              keeping you logged into a website or maintaining the state of your
              shopping cart across pages on a single domain. On the other hand,
              persistent cookies are often used for targeting and advertising
              purposes that follow you across sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's take a look at how long these
              <span class="datum">1,029</span> persistent cookies will be stored
              on my computer.

          Cookies are not inherently malicious. Often they are necessary for
          functionality that impacts your experience on the web in positive
          ways. However, when unknown third parties with unrecognizable names
          store cookies on your computer for up to 100 years with the sole
          purpose of tracking your online activity and serving targeted
          advertisements, we should be concerned about privacy on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          New regulations like the
          <a href="https://eugdpr.org/"
            >General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a
          >
          in the European Union have set new standards for tracking consent on
          the webâ€”â€”<a
            @mouseover="showHoverTip = !showHoverTip, hoverTip('consent')"
            @mouseleave="showHoverTip = !showHoverTip, hoverTip()"
            >the reason you've seen these cookie notifications every time you
            visit a new site</a
          >. However, most companies in the US are doing the bare minimum to
          provide transparency on their cookie usage. The EU continues to lead
          the charge and will potentially provide more clarity on cookies
          consent in an
          <a
            href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/"
            >ePrivacy directive revamp</a
          >
          that may come as soon as Summer 2019, but that still only affects
          companies processing EU residents' data. The experience for internet
          users in the United States may largely stay the same for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitaly Friedman, in an
          <a
            href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-ux-better-cookie-consent-experiences/"
            >article</a
          >
          published in Smashing Magazine, addressed issues surrounding cookies
          and tracking consent from a nuanced design perspective. In an ideal
          state, all websites that use your data would provide cookie management
          settings which allow users to see the purpose and expiration of every
          cookie. Additionally, the ability to toggle different cookies on and
          off would provide complete consent, but that obviously is not in the
          best interest of advertisers who want to place a lot of lengthy
          third-party tracking cookies on your computer.
        </p>
        <h5 class="total">What can you do?</h5>

        <p>
          If you're concerned like I was after my research, one of the easiest
          steps you can take is to turn off third-party cookies. Every major
          browser has this option. Safari already has third-party cookies
          disabled by default and Firefox will be disabling them by default in
          <a

            >Firefox 65</a
          >. But if you're like me and the other 63% of internet
          users<sup>[4]</sup>, you most likely use Chrome, which does not block
          them by default. You can manually block third-party cookies by
